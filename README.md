Load data using the "load from file" button or just enter it in the textbox. After selecting a file a MessageBox will ask if the tree should also be loaded. You will need to do this incase you want to decompress a file.

The "save to file" button opens 2 saveFile dialogs where you can select where to save the file and the tree. The first dialog is the textfile the second the tree.

Enjoy!
